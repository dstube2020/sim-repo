<h1>INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARES<h1>
<p>Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or
 computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in
 contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and
 actually performs the work. In computer science and software 
 engineering, computer software is all information processed by 
 computer systems, programs and data. Computer software includes 
 computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such
 as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and 
 software require each other and neither can be realistically used 
 on its own
